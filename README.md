# 🍪 Simple Cookie Checker for Roblox
Roblox Cookie Checker is a simple script that checks if your Roblox cookie is valid or not.

# 🛑 I'M NOT ADDING FEATURES FOR THIS CHECKER
As I don't have much time I can't put more features to this project as well as some other ones. I'll try to keep it working as long as it is physically possible though.  
Pull requests and Bug reports are welcome!
